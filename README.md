## Plugin Guide
### Setting up a new game
Firstly you will need to create the details of the map, execute
```
/sgadmin setup [name] [min-players] [max-players]
```

```name``` is the name of the map

```min-players``` is the minimum amount of players needed to start the game

```max-players``` is the maximum amount of players the map can hold

<br>

Next you set the map bounderies by selecting two corners of the map, like so

![demo](https://i.stack.imgur.com/aHMgv.png "Map dimentions examples")
For example 1 & 2, or 5 & 7

Once in postion of corner 1, execute
```
/sgadmin setup
```

<br>

Next the second corner of the map

- if you picked position 2, then go to position 1
- if you picked position 5, then go to position 7

Once in position of corner 2, execute
```
/sgadmin setup
```

<br>

Almost there! Now you will need to set the waiting lobby location

Go to where you want players to spawn in the waiting lobby, execute
```
/sgadmin setup
```

<br>

Finally the map needs to be scanned for chests to be filled when the
game starts, once you've added all the chests in you map, execute
```
/sgadmin setup
```

#### Congradulations, you have set up a SurvivalGames map!
